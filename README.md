# YOLO Model Training for Drowsiness Detection
This repository provides comprehensive code and instructions for training a YOLOv8 model to detect drowsiness. Below are the details of the process, including dataset collection, training, testing, and saving the trained model.

# Dataset
Drowsiness Detection.v2-augmented-v1.yolov8: This dataset was collected from Roboflow and includes images specifically annotated for drowsiness detection. The dataset is used to fine-tune the pre-trained YOLOv8 model.

# Training the Model
DrowsinessDetectionnew.ipynb: This file contains the code used to train the YOLOv8 model on the drowsiness detection dataset. After training, the model is saved as best.pt, which contains the optimized weights for drowsiness detection.

# Testing the Model
DrowsinessDetectiontesting: This file contains the code used to test the trained YOLOv8 model. It opens the camera and performs live drowsiness detection using the trained model. This step ensures that the model performs well in real-time scenarios.

# Summary
This repository provides a detailed workflow for developing a drowsiness detection system using the YOLOv8 model. The process includes collecting and annotating a dataset, training the model, and testing it in real-time scenarios. The trained model, best.pt, is the result of fine-tuning the YOLOv8 model on the drowsiness detection dataset.
